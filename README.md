# üöÄ Friendly Web Interface for Machine Leaning Project with Streamlit App üöÄ

Creating and sharing stunning, personalized web apps for machine learning and data science is simple with the help of the open-source Python library Streamlit. In order to develop this app using Streamlit, you must first complete the following steps before beginning: import type_of_day, impute_holiday_data, payday, impute_oil_missing_values, and date_extracts from your function. import Streamlit as st, pandas as pd, numpy as np, import pickle as datetime.


Therefore, you proceed to establish your page title, page icon, and markdown on your page using the Streamlit app. Then, load every pickle file you use in your Streamlit app, add components to your machine learning composition, and develop your function to load pickle files. Add the app's title, then make an expander to house it, a three-column layout, and a date input to accept a date using your expander. To better visualize your app, make a pick box for store city and then add your button.

## Let‚Äôs get started building web apps with Streamlit.

## Install Streamlit
We must understand how to install and configure Streamlit on our computer. Run the following line in your terminal to install Streamlit.

**pip install streamlit**

The following command can be used to see what version of Streamlit is currently installed on our computer.

**streamlit --version**

The command listed below can be used to test the library after Streamlit has been successfully installed.

**streamlit hello**

We can see that a new tab will open in our web browser with the Hello app from Streamlit.

## Run a Streamlit App

Using Streamlit commands, we can write a test Python script and run it with the command listed below.

**streamlit run <test_script.py>**
Development and Data Flow:
The software provides us with two alternatives whenever we make changes to the Streamlit Python script:

. Rerun
. Always rerun

We can use the Always rerun option to have our web app automatically update each time we make a change. With the help of this tool, we can collaborate with Streamlit more easily and streamline our development process.

Additionally, Streamlit has a distinct data flow. Streamlit sends us the whole Python script if anything on our screen is updated.

## Display the Data
Tables, dataframes, and arrays are examples of the sorts of data that can be displayed using Streamlit techniques. For example, we can write a string using the method st.write (‚ÄúOur string‚Äù).

## Widgets and Layouts
Streamlit offers a variety of widgets, including st.slider, st.selectbox, st.checkbox, and others. By ordering our widgets, we can also choose how our app will be laid out. For instance, we can align the data in the left panel using the st.sidebar function.

## How and Where to Deploy Streamlit App?
The New App option is located in the top right corner of the Streamlit website, as seen below. By choosing this option, you can create an app.

. If you have connected your Github account, a new window will appear with a list of your repositories. You can select one and enter the location of its file.
. You can click the Deploy! button once all fields have been filled in. After a few seconds, the app will be visible and operational.
. Make sure your app‚Äôs dependencies and source code are on Github before deploying it, as Streamlit cloud launches apps directly from the Github repository.
